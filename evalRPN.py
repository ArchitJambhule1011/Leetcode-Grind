"""
You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

    The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
    Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
    The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
    There will not be any division by zero.
    The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
    The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.
